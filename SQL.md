Tips.

This is maybe the most common,most useful,most powerful thing to use with a sequel database.

`Selecting data` to answer questions came to the once we were trying to answer with python.

This is the general sytax, anytime you want to select data from a sequel database
- You literally say `SELECT`
- Then specify the column,colums or eles .
- Then you literally say `FROM` that you want to select data from somewhere(column,colums or eles .)
-Then you specify of the name of table,that you want to get that data from. 
- semicolon.
 ```
SELECT columns FROM table;
 ```

 #### Everything that is in capitals here is a sequel keyword.
Strictly, you don't have to capitalize things, it just helps to distinguish sequels from the word you choose. 
But in encouraging us to do stylistically, especially as you're learning and even as you are writing.
